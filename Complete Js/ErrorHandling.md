# Error Handling
In our code, errors may come, when we feel that errors can come in a line we can use a try-catch block to handle errors in code.

## try-catch block
#### syntax
try {
    // normal code
}catch(error) {
    // handling error                   
}

In first block (try) we write our normal code.

if any error come in try block, control will goes to catch block where we can handel our error (we can console log our error).
 
##### if we use try-catch block, it will not stop other lines to be executed
